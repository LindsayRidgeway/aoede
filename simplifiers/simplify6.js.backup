const getSimplificationPrompt = (sourceText, bookLanguage, studyLanguage) => {
  return `Your input (see below) is a string of one or more sentences in ${bookLanguage}.

Please produce your output following the following steps:
1. Write the five-character sentence "/+++/" to the output.
2. Read a sentence (S1) from the input, until you reach a NEWLINE character. Do not attempt to parse the input based on content. An S1 sentence is defined as ending with a NEWLINE.
3. Translate (S1) into ${studyLanguage}, creating S2.
4. Simplify S2 into one or more sentences in ${studyLanguage} so that a typical native 6-year-old ${studyLanguage}-speaking child can understand it, following the guidelines below. Simplifying S2 will produce one or more simplified sentences, S3#1 ... S3#2 ... S3#3 etc.
5. Write each S3 to the output as a separate sentence. DO NOT WRITE ADDITIONAL "/+++/" SENTENCES IN FRONT OF EACH S3.
6. Repeat steps 1-5, until all of the input sentences have been processed. Don't forget to perform step 1 at the beginning of every S1.

Simplification guidelines:
- Break S2 into one or more shorter ones as needed to carry out the following guidelines.
- Vocabulary: very basic vocabulary, except you may use ONE harder word per S3.
- Each S3 should be no longer than 8 words.
- Simplifying the sentence may require you to lose some of its meaning, but do not add your own thoughts of what the sentence might have said instead.
- Sentence structure: Use varied sentence beginnings and structure for the S3 sentences to avoid the monotony of continuous SVO sentences.

Note:
- Please do not add comments, do not number the sentences, and do not produce any other output other than as described above.

Input:
${sourceText}`;
